Track Twitch Popularity
=======================


Twitch.tv is largest streaming website in the world. Thousands of streamers stream for hours each day for upwards of a million viewers.

Streams are grouped by game, and we can see the relative popularity of each stream at the directory page: https://twitch.tv/directory.
